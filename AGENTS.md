# Vivi Agent Guide

## Project

Vivi is the project mailspace for private agents: durable, project-local
coordination state — tasks, needs, wants, mail, memos, roles, goals, and
executable work graphs — driven by the `vivi` CLI.

The codebase is Rust, Edition 2024, with the toolchain pinned in
`rust-toolchain.toml`. Treat `Cargo.toml`, `README.md`, and the code as the
source of truth when these instructions drift.

## Sibling repositories

Vivi was split out of one repository on 2026-09-21. This repo owns the
mailspace half only:

| Repo | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `vivi` (this repo) | Project mailspaces, roles, goals, work graphs, the `vivi` binary |
| `vivi-mail` | IMAP, SMTP, the direct Proton API, sync, send, the local email archive, search, drafts, and the `~/.vivarium/` home |
| `vivi-pty` | The project-scoped PTY runtime adapter |

The three share no code and no data. The mailspace lives at
`<project>/.vivi/`; the email archive lives under the mail root that
`vivi-mail` owns. Do not add a dependency from this repo onto either sibling.

## Current Shape

- Package: `vivi`
- Binary: `vivi`, defined explicitly with `autobins = false`
- Storage: project-local SQLite at `<project>/.vivi/mail.sqlite`, with
  markdown bodies and blobs under the same directory
- Project mailspaces: tasks, needs, wants, mail, memos, roles, **goal path
  registry** (pointers to on-disk factory/campaign goal files), and
  **executable work graphs** (Mermaid import, ready frontier, task-attempt
  binding)

## Agent skill

Agent-facing `vivi` CLI guidance is [`skills/vivi/SKILL.md`](skills/vivi/SKILL.md).
Load that skill for mailspace, role, goal, and graph command usage. Verify live
`--help` before exact flags.

## Work Graphs (project mailspace)

Executable topology lives in project-local `mail.sqlite` tables
(`work_graphs`, `work_graph_nodes`, `work_graph_edges`, revisions, events,
attempts). Mermaid is import/export evidence; readiness is derived from
normalized edges + node state.

| Command family | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `vivi graph import` / `apply` | Atomic create / revise from narrow Mermaid `flowchart` |
| `vivi graph show` / `export` | Mermaid topology only |
| `vivi graph ready` | Compact ready/blocked/active/gates frontier (status loops; `counts` line, `--kind` filter) |
| `vivi graph audit [--repair]` | Backlog citizenship check; repair mints/completes/settles drifted items |
| `vivi graph connect` | Post-hoc prerequisite edge between two backlog items |
| `vivi graph complete` / `activate` | Lifecycle receipts; activate binds a task attempt and refuses operator gates |
| `vivi board --graph` | Frontier projection without replacing task/need board items |
| `vivi need bind` | Lowering: bind unit tasks to a need; join completes the need |
| `vivi step [--apply <handle>]` | Manifest of dispatches/exceptions over the `backlog` graph; apply completes settled items |
| `vivi goal add` / `list` / `show` / `drop` | Register goal file paths; board always surfaces them |
| `vivi trace` | **Communication** tree — not work-graph topology |

**Backlog citizenship.** Every `task` / `need` / `want` send mints an open
node in the per-mailspace `backlog` graph (`source_id` = item handle).
`--depends-on` (task/need/want handles, validated before send) becomes a
prerequisite edge (`graph connect` adds one post-hoc). Lifecycle moves keep
node state in step: done moves complete nodes and unlock dependents; reopen
re-locks; `want promote` never changes node state, and wants never dispatch
in `vivi step` before explicit promotion. The `need bind` join completes
the need's node **and** settles its mailbox item (`via=join`); reopening a
bound unit restores both. Node completions write a `step_decision` graph
event in the same transaction
(`via=lifecycle|graph-complete|step-apply|repair|join`). `graph audit`
detects and repairs citizenship drift — including items sent by vivi
binaries too old to mint nodes (check the version in `mailspace status`;
stale PATH-shadowing installs have caused silent untracked items). No
schema beyond the graph tables.

**Judgment provider (shadow screens).** A mailspace-level `[judgment]` table
in `.vivi/mailspace.toml` (`provider`/`endpoint`/`model`/`timeout_ms`/
`key_cmd`) enables TypeSafe System One screens on `vivi step --apply` only:
one Noul per `done_when` clause plus a completion-honesty Noul, answers
appended to `.vivi/judgment-corpus.jsonl`. Shadow by design — provider
answers never gate mechanical completions. Auth is exclusively `key_cmd`
(`sh -c`, `password_cmd` semantics; no envvar, no inline key).
Absent/failing/timed-out providers degrade to `judgment=skipped(<class>)`.
No read path makes provider calls.

Invariant: Vivi decides which graph nodes are eligible (ready). The Mind
dispatches. Fleet (`prepare --node` → claim → activate) proves execution.
Do not encode Fleet roles inside Vivi core.

## Coding Standards

- Prefer existing modules and helper APIs before adding new abstractions.
- Keep production errors in `VivariumError` with `thiserror`; do not introduce `anyhow`.
- Avoid panics in production paths. Return `Result` where practical, and only use
  `unreachable!` or `unwrap` for truly invariant conditions.
- Use `clap` derive for CLI parsing.
- Use `tracing-subscriber` for logging.
- Use `tokio` for async work; the CLI entrypoint uses `#[tokio::main]`.
- Keep files and functions small. Hygiene tests enforce a 1000-line file ceiling
  and a 60-line function ceiling for checked `src/**/*.rs` files.
- Prefer `module.rs` files until a module genuinely needs submodules. When it
  does, use `module/leaf.rs` files with a parent `module.rs` rather than
  `module/mod.rs`.
- Put inline unit tests in `#[cfg(test)]` modules near the code when that keeps
  behavior easy to understand. Use `tests/` for integration and CLI behavior.

## Entry Point

`src/main.rs` should keep the current shape:

- `main()` parses `Cli`, initializes tracing, calls `run(...)`, prints errors to
  stderr, and exits nonzero on failure.
- `run(...)` returns `Result<(), VivariumError>`.
- Shared library behavior belongs under `src/lib.rs` modules; CLI dispatch
  glue can stay in `src/main.rs` and runner modules.

## Configuration

- The mailspace config is `<project>/.vivi/mailspace.toml`.
- `--project` names the project root; otherwise the nearest ancestor holding
  `.vivi/mailspace.toml` wins.
- This repo holds no credentials and resolves no user-level home directory.
- Config is `serde` + `toml`.

## Validation

Before finishing code changes, run the narrowest useful check first, then widen
as risk increases:

- `cargo fmt --check`
- `cargo test --test hygiene`
- `cargo test`

For documentation-only edits, at least inspect links or run a small local
Markdown link scan when the touched file contains links.

## Dependency Policy

Use the dependencies already in `Cargo.toml` when possible. Important current
crates include:

- CLI and runtime: `clap`, `tokio`, `tracing-subscriber`
- Config and errors: `serde`, `serde_json`, `toml`, `thiserror`
- Local message composition and parsing: `lettre`, `mail-builder`, `mail-parser`
- Storage and identity: `rusqlite`, `sha2`, `hex`, `chrono`
- Process probing: `sysinfo`
- Judgment provider: `reqwest`
- Paths: `dirs`

Do not add a new dependency for small local logic that is already covered by
the standard library or existing crates.
