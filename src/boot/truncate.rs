//! Per-section caps and the truncation manifest.
//!
//! A boot digest is a frame, so it has a budget. Every section caps its rows,
//! records what it dropped, and the digest closes by naming each cap. The
//! reader then knows the digest is complete in coverage and bounded in length,
//! and knows where to look for the rest.
//!
//! Caps are constants rather than flags: boot is one command with one shape,
//! and a caller-tuned budget would make two boot runs incomparable.
